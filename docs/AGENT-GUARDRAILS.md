# astro-business-starter — agent rules

Reusable static template for small-business websites. Clean, fast, professional.
This file is the authoritative guardrail for working in this repo; the demo brand's
visual spec is docs/DESIGN.md. Do not substitute the stack choices below.

## Stack (non-negotiable)

- Astro 5, static output. Tailwind CSS v4 via @tailwindcss/vite ONLY —
  never @astrojs/tailwind, never tailwind.config.js (CSS-first @theme).
- No React/Vue/Svelte. Pure .astro components only.
- Animation: GSAP + Lenis only, and only via src/scripts/motion.ts.
- Fonts: Fontsource variable packages only. No Google Fonts CDN, no external fonts.
- Package manager: pnpm. Docs lookups: consult Context7 before writing any
  Tailwind v4 or Astro 5 config — do not rely on memory for these APIs.

## Theming discipline (the core contract of this template)

- ALL visual identity lives in the @theme block of src/styles/global.css
  and the font imports in Base.astro. Nothing else.
- Components reference design tokens only. NEVER hardcode hex colors,
  border-radius values, or shadows in components or pages.
- One brand color (--color-brand). Neutrals carry the rest.
- Reference tokens with the paren shorthand: `py-(--spacing-section)`, `rounded-(--radius-base)` — the `[--token]` bracket form is invalid in Tailwind v4 (compiles without `var()`, silently no-ops).
- All business facts (name, contact, hours, nav, socials, form endpoint,
  analytics) live in src/config/site.ts. Never inline them in components.

## Design quality bar (aesthetic direction comes from the frontend-design

## skill per client; these floors always apply)

- One H1 per page. Body text 16–18px, line-height ≥ 1.6, measure ≤ 70ch.
- Section rhythm: --spacing-section padding, alternating surface/surface-alt.
- Exactly one primary CTA style per page; conversion path obvious.
- WCAG AA contrast, visible focus states, 44px tap targets.
- Motion: subtle, enter-only, ≤ 0.6s. No pinning or scroll-jacking.
- prefers-reduced-motion fully honored; site must be complete with JS disabled
  (nav, FAQ accordion, and form all work without JS).
- Images only via astro:assets <Image /> with explicit dimensions.

## Workflow

- Every component ≤ 80 lines. Prefer composition over prop flags.
- After every batch of edits: run `pnpm check` then `pnpm build`.
  Both must pass before a task is done.
- Adding a service/team member/pricing tier/FAQ must require only a new markdown
  file — if a code change is needed, the design is wrong; fix the template.
- Do not add dependencies beyond those already in package.json without asking.

## Definition of done

- astro check clean; build has no warnings except the documented empty optional
  `pages` collection warning while that collection is unused
- Lighthouse mobile: Perf ≥ 95, A11y ≥ 95, SEO 100
- Client JS < 60KB gzipped
- No hex values in src/components or src/pages (grep to verify)
- Rebrand test passes: site.ts + @theme + font swap = coherent new brand

## Stock images

Use the image-banks MCP (Pexels). Always download into src/assets/images/
(never hotlink), prefer landscape ≥1600px for hero images and portrait for
team slots. Record photographer name + Pexels URL in
docs/IMAGE-CREDITS.md. Serve only via astro:assets <Image /> with explicit
dimensions.

## Visual verification (mandatory for any UI change)

After any change affecting rendering: start `pnpm dev`, use Playwright MCP to
screenshot the affected pages at 1440px and 375px widths, view the screenshots,
and check them against docs/DESIGN.md before declaring the task done.
Specifically check: section spacing/rhythm, typography scale, contrast,
and anything that reads as a generic template.

## Privacy discipline

- The privacy policy must stay accurate to what the site ACTUALLY does. Any
  change that adds data collection — analytics, embeds, pixels, new form
  fields, third-party scripts — is a privacy-policy-impacting change: update
  src/pages/privacy.astro in the SAME task, driven by src/config/site.ts `legal`.
- Default stance: no cookies, no analytics, and no third-party browser requests
  beyond the form processor and Cloudflare hosting/Turnstile. Adding any new
  third-party request requires asking first.
- Never present policy text as legal advice. Keep the "client must review with
  counsel" comment at the bottom of privacy.astro and terms.astro intact.

## Accessibility discipline

- Every UI-affecting task must end with `pnpm test:a11y` passing (zero axe
  violations, every page) IN ADDITION to `pnpm check` && `pnpm build`.
- Any new interactive component ships with keyboard tests in tests/a11y.spec.ts
  covering: reachability (Tab), a visible focus indicator, the expected key
  operation, and escape/close behaviour where applicable. No keyboard test,
  not done.
- Prefer native HTML elements (details, popover, dialog, button) over
  ARIA-recreated widgets. Adding `role=` or `aria-*` to recreate a behaviour a
  native element already provides requires written justification in the diff.
- A Lighthouse accessibility score of 100 is a FLOOR, not proof — it only
  reflects the subset of checks that can be automated. Manual keyboard and
  screen-reader passes (see docs/PRE-LAUNCH-CHECKLIST.md) are still required.
- The site must respect OS/browser-level user preferences: prefers-reduced-motion,
  prefers-contrast, browser font-size, and pinch zoom. Never add
  `user-scalable=no`, a maximum-scale restriction, a px root font-size, or
  anything else that overrides these.
- prefers-contrast adjustments live ONLY in the token media block in
  src/styles/global.css (`@media (prefers-contrast: more)`) — never per-component.
- POLICY: Never add third-party accessibility overlay widgets or toolbars
  (accessiBe, UserWay, or similar), or homegrown equivalents (font-size buttons,
  "colorblind mode" toggles). Accessibility is built into the code and responds
  to real user preferences; overlays add tracking, can break assistive
  technology, and provide no legal protection. If asked to add one, decline and
  reference this policy and docs/CLIENT-SETUP.md.

## SEO discipline

- Every new page requires a UNIQUE title and description at creation time. `<SEO>` throws at
  build if description is missing, and the prop is typed required — do not weaken either. Titles
  follow the convention: homepage `[primaryService] in [city] | [businessName]`, inner pages
  `[Page Title] | [businessName]` (built in SEO.astro from site.ts).
- Renaming any route or content slug requires a matching `301` line in `public/_redirects` in the
  SAME task — never ship a renamed URL without its redirect.
- Business facts used for SEO — NAP (name/address/phone), hours, and service areas — may ONLY come
  from src/config/site.ts. Never hardcode them in a component, page, or JSON-LD builder. LocalBusiness
  JSON-LD (areaServed, geo, openingHours) and the footer "Serving:" line are generated from site.ts;
  keep them that way so a rebrand stays a one-file edit.
- /sitemap-index.xml, /robots.txt, and /llms.txt are generated at build time from `site` + site.ts.
  Adding a new page type means confirming it lands in (or is correctly excluded from) the sitemap.
- Internal links never use trailing slashes (`trailingSlash: 'never'`). Author hrefs, canonicals,
  sitemap entries, and feed links slash-free — SEO.astro normalises canonicals; keep new link/URL
  builders consistent.
